My github account was opened in 2021 and I have amassed a total of 1 follower who is my friend. I have one finished project that I am pretty proud of; it's a fully fledged website with login features.

This repository is pretty barren at the moment (it only contains this README file).

It was very easy to clone this repository to my PC using the GUI of github desktop. I first clicked the clone repository button and then I chose a folder I wanted the files to be stored.
